# auction_of_premium_training_spots_group60

As the owner of a gym, you’ve partnered with famous sportspeople and coaches to offer exclusive training sessions at select time slots. These sessions are extremely valuable, but instead of assigning a fixed price, you want to let the market decide through an auction system.

Each training session is represented as a unique NFT (ERC-721 token) — an asset that guarantees access to that exclusive training spot with a specic coach.

Users can bid on these premium spots, and the highest bidder wins the right to attend. This ensures fairness and transparency in allocating these limited high-value experiences.
